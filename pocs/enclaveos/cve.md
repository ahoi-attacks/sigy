## EnclaveOS allows malicious signal injection

### Tested on versions:
EnclaveOS version 3.36.1941-EM

### Description:
An attacker can break the security of an SGX application that uses EnclaveOS. EnclaveOS assumes an untrusted operating system that can inject signals to the SGX enclave. EnclaveOS forwards signals from the operating system to the SGX enclave. A malicious operating system can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of apps running inside EnclaveOS by injecting signals and arbitrarily triggering enclave signal handlers.
